# Why cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency allows end-users to send tips and issue funding for Github Issues without 

* bureacracy
* trusted intermediaries
* international payment fees
* credit card fees

# What is Gitcoin?

## Network Values, Mission, and Culture

Read about our culture and mission at https://github.com/gitcoinco/gitcoinco/issues/6 

## Features

_A tip_ is a tool to send ether or any ethereum token to any github account. The flow for tips looks like this:

> Send (party 1) => receive (party 2)

_Funded Issues_ are a way to fund open source features, bugs, or security bounties. The flow for funded issues looks like this:

> Fund Issue (party 1) => claim funds (party 2) => accept (party 1)

## What kinds of issues make great funded issues? 

Gitcoin supports bug, feature, and security funded issues.  Any issue that you need done is a good candidate for a funded issue, provided that:

* It’s open today.
* The repo README clearly enumerates how a new developer should get set up to contribute.
* The task is well defined.
* The end-state of the task is well defined.
* The pricing of the task reflects (market rate * complexity) of the task.
* The issue is on the roadmap, but does not block other work.

To get started with funded issues today, it might be good to start small.  Is there a small bug that needs fixed?  An issue that’s been open for a while that no one is tackling?  An administrative task?

Post your issue on the [Issue Explorer](https://gitcoin.co/explorer).
